# -Crazy-Eights
This program allows one player to play a game of Crazy Eights against the computer. Crazy Eights is a game that uses a standard deck of 52 cards. 
Specifically, each card has a rank and a suit. There are 13 ranks: the numbers 2 through 10, Jack (usually represented with the letter J), Queen (Q), King (K),
and Ace (A). There are 4 suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. In a 52-card deck, there is one card of each rank for each suit.

Rules:
Each player is dealt 7 cards. The remaining cards are placed face-down (i.e. with their rank and suit hidden) in a stack on the table and becomes the "stock",
with the top card turned over and displayed in a separate "pile". The first player to go must place one card face up on the starter pile.
Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination. If unable to play,
cards are drawn from the top of the stock until a play is possible, or until the stock is exhausted. If unable to play when the stock is exhausted,
the player must pass. A player may draw from the stock, even though there may be a playable card in the playerâ€™s hand. All eights are wild! That is,
an eight may be played at any time in turn, and the player need only specify a suit for it (but never a number). The next player must play either a
card of the specified suit or an eight. The game continues with the players alternating turns until one of the players gets rid of all the cards in their hand,
or until all of the cards are drawn and no one can play a card. If neither player has zero cards at the end of the game, the player with the least amount of
cards in their hand wins.
